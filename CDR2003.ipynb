    "\n",
    "7. The distribution of earnings\n",
    "\n",
    "    The distributions of earnings are very similar in both economies and the benchmark model economy does a significantly better job of accounting for the observed distribution of earnings than any of the previous attempts in the prvious literature. Authors conjecture that the differences between the Lorenz curves of earnings in the model economy and in the data would have been smaller if they had chosen a process on $s$ of a higher dimension.\n",

    "9. The distribution of consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consumption is more unequally distributed in the model economy than in the U.S. economy. The shares of the lowest four quintiles resemble the data significantly more than those of the top quintile. The distributions of consumption in the United States and in the model economies are almost the same after excluding the wealthiest 1 percent of the model economy.\n",

    "    \n",
    "11. An assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "    A more sophisticated implementation of the age-earnings profile of households would greatly enhance the ability of this class of model economies to address the life cycle profile of earnings, the intergenerational transmission of earnings, and the economic mobility of households simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Two Robustness Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Two robustness exercises were carried out to see whether the mismatch of the intergenerational correlation of earnings and the ratio of the average earnings of households between ages 60 and 41 to that of households between ages 40 and 21 is an important shorcoming of the model.\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Accurate Intergenaretional Transmission of Earnings Ability at the Expense of the Life Cycle Profile of Earnings\n",
    "2. Accurate Life Cycle Profile of Earnings at the Expense of the Intergenerational Transmission of Earnings Ability\n",
    "\n",
    "### VI. A Policy Experiment: Abolishing Estate Taxation\n",
    "We find that abolishing estate taxation brings about an increase in the steady-state output of 0.35 percent and an increase in the steadystate stock of capital of 0.87 percent in steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VII. Concluding Comments\n",
    "The model shows that uninsured idiosyncratic earnings risk, retirement, altruism, and government transfers to retired households are essential ingredients to replicate the oberved earnings to wealth ratios of both rich and the poor households. Earnings process calibration is necessary to replicate the observed distributions of earnings and wealth sufficiently. No preference distinguishment between the poor and the rich is supposed in this model. Instead, two groups can be seen as the same type of people who have been subject to a different set of circumstances."
