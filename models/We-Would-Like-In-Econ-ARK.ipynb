    "2. An unemployed HH has a very low transitory income.\n",
    "3. Contingent on becoming unemployed, the expected permanent income drops by 10% (a la von Wachter and others).\n",
    "    * In normal times, the likelihood of going to a very low states of the permanent component of income is very low.\n",
    "    * However, in bad times, the likelihood of going to very low states increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The specification\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to describe the income process, we need 3 state variables,\n",
    "  * $\\omega$ -- employment (or aggregate) state.\n",
    "  * $\\mathbb{p}$ -- persistent component of income.\n",
    "  * $\\theta$ -- transitory component of income.\n",
    "* $\\omega$ -- employment state (or can be called an aggregate state, in which case it becomes H,L rather than e,u)\n",

    "  * Denoting the transition probability of switching from employment (unemployment) in period $t$ to employment (unemployment) in period $t+1$ by $\\rho_{e}$ ($\\rho_{u}$), the transition matrix is given by:\n",

    "  * 3-state Markov chain: $\\mathbb{p} \\in \\mathbb{P}= \\{\\mathbb{p}_{1},\\mathbb{p}_{2},\\mathbb{p}_{3}\\}$\n",
    "  * *The transition probabilities for this Markov process depend on the employment state and are given by $\\lambda(\\mathbb{p}'|\\mathbb{p},\\omega,\\omega')$. Assuming the law of large numbers, the idiosyncratic risk averages out, and only the aggregate risk determines the number of agents in a specific idiosyncratic persistent income state, $\\mathbb{p}$. Moreover, we assume that the share of households in a given idiosyncratic persistent income state $\\mathbb{p}$ only depends on the current aggregate state $\\omega$. This assumption imposes consistency restrictions on the transition matrix $\\lambda(\\mathbb{p}'|\\mathbb{p},\\omega,\\omega')$.*\n",

    "* Consumption predictions of the model are ***sensitive to the chosen calibration target for consumer savings***.\n",

    "  * There is also a decline in productivity, as the indebted HHs are less productive.\n",
    "* In a model with durables, after a credit crunch, net borrowers are forced to deleverage and have to reduce consumption of durable and nondurable goods.

     "abstract": "The goal of this chapter is study how, and by how much household income, wealth and preference heterogeneity ampliﬁes and propagates a macroeconomic shock. We focus on the U.S. Great Recession of 2007-2009 and proceed in two steps. First, using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document the patterns of household income, consumption and wealth inequality before and during the Great Recession. We then investigate how households in different segments of the wealth distribution were affected by income declines, and how they changed their expenditures differentially during the aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence we study several variants of a standard heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and an endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key model ﬁnding is that wealth inequality can signiﬁcantly amplify the impact of an aggregate shock, but it does so if (and only if) the distribution features a sufﬁciently large fraction of households with very little net worth, as is empirically observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role social insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance, play for shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business cycles.",
