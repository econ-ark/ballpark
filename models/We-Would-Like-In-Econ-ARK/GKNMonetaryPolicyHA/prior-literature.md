# Prior Literature Summary: Monetary Policy with Heterogeneous Agents

## The papers my ballpark paper cites

The paper builds on two major strands of macroeconomic research. The first is the New Keynesian literature on monetary policy, which emphasizes nominal rigidities and interest-rate rules as the core transmission mechanisms of monetary policy. Foundational work such as Woodford (1998) established that monetary policy can be analyzed in “cashless” New Keynesian models where inflation dynamics are governed by interest rate rules rather than money supply, providing the standard framework used in modern DSGE analysis. Within this framework, much of the earlier literature relied on representative-agent assumptions, abstracting from distributional consequences of monetary policy.

The second strand concerns heterogeneous-agent macroeconomics with incomplete markets and labor market frictions. Starting with Aiyagari (1994), the literature showed that uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and borrowing constraints generate precautionary saving and realistic wealth distributions. Subsequent work, summarized by Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2009), emphasized how heterogeneity matters for aggregate dynamics and welfare. Parallel research incorporated search and matching frictions into general equilibrium models of unemployment (e.g., Costain and Reiter, 2005; Jung and Kuester, 2011), highlighting the welfare costs of labor market risk over the business cycle. However, much of this work studied fiscal policy or business cycles rather than monetary policy. The contribution of the ballpark paper is to integrate heterogeneous households, incomplete markets, and search frictions into a New Keynesian framework, allowing for a quantitative assessment of the redistributive and welfare effects of monetary policy.

## Key foundational papers

- **Woodford (1998), _Doing without Money_**: Established the modern New Keynesian framework in which monetary policy is conducted through interest rate rules rather than money aggregates.
- **Aiyagari (1994), _Uninsured Idiosyncratic Risk and Aggregate Saving_**: Provided the canonical incomplete-markets model generating precautionary saving and realistic wealth inequality.
- **Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2009), _Quantitative Macroeconomics with Heterogeneous Households_**: Synthesized the heterogeneous-agent literature and clarified why distributional considerations matter for macroeconomic outcomes.
- **Costain and Reiter (2005), _Stabilization versus Insurance_**: Introduced unemployment risk and precautionary saving into general equilibrium models, highlighting welfare trade-offs under incomplete markets.
- **Jung and Kuester (2011), _(Un)importance of Unemployment Fluctuations_**: Quantified welfare costs of business cycles in models with search frictions, motivating the importance of labor market risk for policy analysis.
