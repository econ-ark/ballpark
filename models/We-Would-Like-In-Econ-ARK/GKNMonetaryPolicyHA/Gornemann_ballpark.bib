               redistribution effects of monetary policy shocks; a
               contractionary monetary policy shock increases income and welfare
               of the wealthiest 5 percent, while the remaining 95 percent
               experience lower income and welfare. Consequently, the negative
               effect of a contractionary monetary policy shock to social
               welfare is larger if heterogeneity is taken into account.",

               aggregates are of little use as targets or even indicators for
               monetary policy, owing to the instability of money demand
               relations in economies with well-developed financial markets. But
               monetary theory has provided little guidance for the analysis of
               policies that are not formulated in terms of a path for the money
               supply, and a stable money demand relation is generally assumed
               as a central element of a theoretical analysis. This paper,
               instead, shows that it is possible to analyze equilibrium
               inflation determination without any reference to either money
               supply or demand, as long as one specifies policy in terms of a
               'Wicksellian' interest-rate feedback rule. The paper's central
               result is an approximation theorem, showing the existence, for a
               simple monetary model, of a well-behaved 'cashless limit' in
               which the money balances held to facilitate transactions become
               negligible. The relations that determine equilibrium inflation in
               the cashless limit also provide a useful approximate account in
               the case of an economy in which monetary frictions are present,
               but small. The approximation remains valid in the case of time
               variation in the monetary frictions, including variation of a
               kind that may result in substantial instability of money demand
               in percentage terms. Inflation in the cashless limit is shown to
               be a function of the gap between the 'natural rate' of interest,
               determined by the supply of goods and opportunities for
               intertemporal substitution, and a time-varying parameter of the
               interest-rate rule indicating the tightness of monetary policy.
               Inflation can be completely stabilized, in principle, by
               adjusting the policy parameter so as to track variation in the
               natural rate. Under such a regime, instability of money demand
               has little effect upon equilibrium inflation, and need not be
               monitored by the central bank.",

               borrowing constraint. This asset market structure implies that
               the consumption of low wealth households is sensitive to tax

               consumption increases following tax cuts, and large consumption
               falls following tax increases. When taxes are lump-sum, for
               example, a dollar change in tax revenue is associated with a 15
               cent change in aggregate consumption, compared to a response of
               roughly one third this size when markets are complete but

  abstract  = "Since the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009, the
               unemployment rate has recovered slowly, falling by only 1
               percentage point from its peak by September 2011. We find that
               the lackluster labor market recovery can be traced in large part
               to weakness in aggregate demand; only a small part seems
               attributable to increases in labor market frictions. This
               continued labor market weakness has led to the highest level of
               long-term unemployment in the postwar period and a blurring of
               the distinction between unemployment and nonparticipation in the
               labor force. We show that flows from nonparticipation to
               unemployment are important for understanding recent changes in
               the duration distribution of unemployment. Simulations that
               account for these flows suggest that the labor market is unlikely
               to be subject to high levels of structural long-term unemployment
               after aggregate demand recovers.",

               business cycle model with search and matching frictions in the
               labor market. We endogenously link both the cyclical fluctuations
               and the mean level of unemployment to the aggregate business
               cycle risk. The key result of the paper is that business cycles
               are costly: fluctuations over the cycle induce a higher average
               unemployment rate since employment is nonlinear in the
               job-finding rate and the past unemployment rate. We show this
               analytically for a special case of the model. We then calibrate
               the model to U.S. data. For the calibrated model, too, business
               cycles cause higher average unemployment; the welfare cost of
               business cycles can easily be an order of magnitude larger than
               Lucas's (1987) estimate. The cost of business cycles is the
               higher the lower the value of nonemployment is, or, equivalently,
               the lower is the disutility of work. The ensuing cost of business
               cycles rises further when workers' skills depreciate during
               unemployment.",

               cost of business cycles and locate the optimum in a set of simple
               cyclical fiscal policies. Our economy exhibits productivity
               shocks, giving firms an incentive to hire more when productivity
               is high. However, business cycles make workers' income riskier,
               both by increasing the unconditional probability of unusually
               long unemployment spells, and by making wages more variable, and
               therefore they decrease social welfare by around one-fourth or
               one-third of 1\% of consumption. Optimal fiscal policy offsets
               the cycle, holding unemployment benefits constant but varying the
               tax rate procyclically to smooth hiring. By running a deficit of
               4\% to 5\% of output in recessions, the government eliminates
               half the variation in the unemployment rate, most of the
               variation in workers' aggregate consumption, and most of the
               welfare cost of business cycles.",

               models of the U.S., identified by imposing restrictions on the

               the implications of a popular class of DSGE models, with both
               real and nominal frictions, and with sufficiently wide ranges for
               their parameters. This identification strategy thus substitutes
               theoretically motivated restrictions for the atheoretical
               assumptions on the time-series properties of the data that are
               key to long-run restrictions. Stochastic technology improvements
               persistently increase real wages, consumption, investment and
               output in the data; hours worked are very likely to increase,
               displaying a hump-shaped pattern. Contrary to most of the related
