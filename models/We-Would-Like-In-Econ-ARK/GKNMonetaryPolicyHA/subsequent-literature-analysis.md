## What the subsequent literature tells us

The subsequent literature expands the analysis of monetary policy in heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian (HANK) models along several key dimensions. A first major research direction focuses on the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy in economies with household heterogeneity, especially through marginal propensities to consume (MPCs), wealth distributions, and labor income risk. Papers such as Herkenhoff (2015), Alves (2019), and Chen (2018) study how incomplete markets and heterogeneity reshape aggregate responses to monetary shocks relative to representative-agent New Keynesian models, highlighting the importance of redistribution and household balance sheets.

A second strand integrates labor market frictions more deeply into HANK frameworks. Building on the search-and-matching structure emphasized by Görnemann et al. (2012), subsequent work examines unemployment risk, job finding probabilities, and wage rigidity as key channels through which monetary policy affects welfare and inequality. Contributions by Hagedorn (2018), Bertsch (2017), and Jones (2017) show that labor market heterogeneity amplifies distributional effects and can substantially alter optimal policy prescriptions. More recent papers also explore international and empirical dimensions, connecting HANK models to observed cross-country differences and micro data on consumption and income dynamics.

Overall, the cutting edge of the literature lies in combining rich household heterogeneity with empirically grounded labor market dynamics and policy rules. Open questions remain regarding identification of redistribution channels in the data, the role of firm heterogeneity, and the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy in HANK environments. A researcher aiming to contribute to this field would need strong computational skills, familiarity with heterogeneous-agent DSGE methods, and a clear empirical or policy motivation.
