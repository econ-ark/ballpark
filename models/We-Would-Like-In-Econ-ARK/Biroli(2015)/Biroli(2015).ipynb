    "The paper develops a structural model of health and human captial formation illustrating the dynamic interaction between genetic inheritance and investments in health over the life cycle.  \n",

    "* Using BMI as a measure of health, the paper considers physical activity and food intake as investments in health.  \n",
    "* The result shows that Gene-Environment interaction plays a pivotal role in the evolution of BMI. Food intake has a stronger impact on BMI.  \n",

    "* Adolescents carrying the A-allele in the FTO genotype are at greater risk of obesity, even when consuming the same calories and performing the same physical activity as the adolescents with the other genotype. Their production function is shifted, with a rate of conversion of calories into BMI 1/3 steeper. Instead of counterbalancing this effect with a stricter diet, they tend to consume 2% more calories, suggesting a difference in their preferences for food intake. There is no evidence of a significant interaction between the FTO genotype and physical activity.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* 35.4% of this differences is attributable to changes in productivity parameters of the BMI production function; the remaining 64.5% is attributable to changes in the investments. Secondly, calibrating a structural model.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* A high calorie tax almost eliminates the difference in BMI across genetic groups. An early childhood policy target at reducing caloric intake in the first 10 years of life does not have the same equalizing effect, but still manages to lower BMI in the long run.\n",
