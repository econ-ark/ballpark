    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper uses a two-sector OLG model with heterogeneous entrepreneurial agents to explore how wealth and capital income taxation differ in their welfare implications when there is rate-of-return heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main findings are as follows:\n",
    "* With rate-of-return heterogeneity, wealth taxation (as opposed to capital income taxation) shifts the tax burden towards unproductive entrepreneurs, and gives the productive ones better incentives to save. This generates a reallocation of capital towards productive entrepreneurs, raising output and allowing the government to lower labor income taxes.\n",
    "* In a model aimed at matching the U.S., the authors simulation exercises display an average welfare gain of 7.5% in consumption terms to newborns from switching from capital income to wealth taxation.\n",
    "* In the same model, the authors estimate that the optimal wealth tax rate is 2%-3%. In contrast, if only captial income and labor income taxes were available, it would be optimal to subsidize capital income.\n"

    "### Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rate-of-return heterogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent empirical literature (e.g. Fagereng, Guiso, Malacrino and Pistaferri (2016a)) has found evidence that there is persistent heterogeneity on the risk-adjusted rates of return that households face on their assets. This is important because:\n",
    "* A theoretical result implying that wealth and capital-income taxation are equivalent relies on the assumption that returns on investment are homogeneous.\n",
    "* The empirical distribution of wealth has a thick tail that is not easily matched by models without rate-of-return heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-technical methodological overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the effects of wealth and capital income taxation, the authors construct a model in which agents have different degrees of entrepreneurial ability which also varies over time and generations. Therefore, unproductive agents can end up with large wealth from their predecesors or their youth. Futhermote, there are financial constraints that prevent wealth from perfectly reallocating to efficient entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors use simulations of the model under different tax policies to find their welfare implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The two main effect of wealth taxation\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching from capital income taxes to wealth taxes has two main effects that help in understanding the results of the paper:\n",
    "1. __\"Use it or lose it\" effect__: under capital income taxes, more productive entrepreneurs pay a higher taxes on their investments. Switching to wealth taxes reduces this phenomenon, redistributing the tax burden towards less productive entrepreneurs and allowing more productive ones to keep more of their capital than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __\"Behavioral response\"__: taxes compress the distribution of after-tax returns, but this phenomenon is much larger under capital income taxation. Thus, switching to wealth taxation spreads the distribution of the effective returns to investment and elicits a saving response that shifts capital towards more productive agents."

    "\n",

    "The table shows that both reforms produce average welfare gains, that the optimal income capital tax in the OCIT case is a large subsidy, and that the optimal wealth tax in the OWT case is just above 3%. The average welfare gain is greater under wealth taxation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The table shows that under OCIT a very large increase in the stock of capital occurs, given that its returns are subsidized. Also, as the government needs to balance its budget given the subsidies, labor income taxes are increased and thus, the increase in after-tax wages is modest, so there are level gains with distributional losses. On the other hand, under OWT, there is a very modest increase in the stock of capital, but a large gain in efficiency (compare $Q$ with K and see and TFP) due to the reallocation mechanism. Since the wealth tax allows for a lower labor income tax rates, higher after-tax wages and a labor increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment shows that the OCIT shifts the tax burden from capital to labor, and the OWT does the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important point to consider is that since under OCIT the capital stock must dramatically increase, accounting for a transition period generates short term welfare losses given that higher savings are required. The required thightening is much softer under OWT, since the increase in the capital stock is subtle. This point strengthens the argument for wealth taxes."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the presence of rate-of-return heterogeneity, capital income taxes disproportionately affect productive entrepreneurs. Switching to wealth taxation moves the tax burden towards unproductive entrepreneurs and increases after-tax return heterogeneity, which elicits a reallocation of capital towards productive entrepreneurs. The increased efficiency and the expanded tax base increase output and allow the government to reduce labor income taxes. The authors therefore conclude that wealth taxation can increase efficiency and output while decreasing consumption inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through simulation exercises calibrated to match U.S. data, the authors find that the optimal wealth tax rate is around 3%."
