# Prior Literature Summary: Monetary Policy, Heterogeneity, and the Housing Channel

## The papers my ballpark paper cites

The HKM&O (2017) paper sits on several strands of prior work. **Housing, wealth, and consumption:** Micro evidence showed that house prices affect spending in different ways for different households—e.g. Campbell and Cocco (2007) and Case, Quigley, and Shiller (2011) found important housing-wealth or collateral effects, while Attanasio et al. (2009) and Browning et al. (2013) stressed collateral/credit and common factors rather than a pure wealth effect. That heterogeneity in who responds to house prices and why is central to a “housing channel” of policy. **Heterogeneity and monetary transmission:** Work on hand-to-mouth and “wealthy hand-to-mouth” (Kaplan, Violante, and Weidner 2014), partial consumption insurance (Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston 2008; Kaplan and Violante 2010), and the redistribution channel of monetary policy (Auclert 2019; Di Maggio, Kermani, and Ramcharan 2014; Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima 2014) showed that differences in marginal propensities to consume and in exposure to interest rates and inflation are key for how monetary policy affects aggregate demand. **Housing and mortgages in general equilibrium:** Models with heterogeneous households, illiquid housing, default, and foreclosures—e.g. Jeske, Krueger, and Mitman (2013), Hedlund (2016), Corbae and Quintin (2015), and Favilukis (2010)—and “balance sheet recession” ideas (Huo and Ríos-Rull 2013) provided the tools to embed a frictional housing market and mortgage contracts in a macro model. Together, this literature gave the ingredients HKM&O use: a heterogeneous-agent framework where housing is illiquid and collateral matters, and where monetary policy works partly through the housing channel and redistribution, which their paper then formalizes in a single model of “monetary policy, heterogeneity, and the housing channel.”

## Key foundational papers

- **Jeske, Krueger & Mitman (2013)**: Same author (Mitman), same theme—heterogeneous-agent model with housing, mortgages, and default; direct methodological and topical precursor.
- **Hedlund (2016)**: Same author (Hedlund)—illiquid housing, debt, and foreclosures; supplies the “frictional housing” block and cyclical housing/debt dynamics that HKM&O build on.
- **Kaplan & Violante (2010, 2014)**: Consumption insurance and “wealthy hand-to-mouth”; establish that MPC heterogeneity is central for aggregate consumption and policy, so the housing channel matters precisely because of this heterogeneity.
- **Blundell, Pistaferri & Preston (2008)**: BPP partial-insurance framework; empirical and conceptual base for the consumption-insurance/heterogeneity literature that Kaplan–Violante and HKM&O build on.
- **Campbell & Cocco (2007)**: Micro evidence on how house prices affect consumption by age/tenure; canonical support for a housing channel and for heterogeneity in that response.
- **Favilukis (2010)**: Early heterogeneous-agent GE model with housing wealth, housing finance, and limited risk-sharing; methodological precedent for putting housing in a macro model.
- **Di Maggio, Kermani & Ramcharan (2014)**: Direct evidence on monetary policy pass-through to consumption via mortgages (e.g. ARM resets) and higher MPC for constrained borrowers; empirical counterpart to the mechanism in HKM&O.
