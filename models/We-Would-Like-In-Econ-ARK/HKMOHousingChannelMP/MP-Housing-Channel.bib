               from unexpected inflation, and an interest rate exposure channel
               from real interest rate changes. Sufficient statistics from
               Italian and US data suggest that all three channels are likely to
               amplify the effects of monetary policy. (JEL E21, E31, E43, E52)",

               households select from a set of mortgage contracts and choose
               whether to default on their payments given realizations of income
               and housing price shocks. The set of mortgage contracts consists
               of loans with high downpayments and loans with low downpayments.
               We run an experiment where the use of low downpayment loans is
               initially limited by payment-to-income requirements but then
               becomes unrestricted for 8 years. The relaxation of approval
               standards causes homeownership rates, high-leverage originations
               and the frequency of high interest rate loans to rise much like
               they did in the US between 1998-2006. When home values fall by
               the magnitude observed in the US from 2007-08, default rates
               increase by over 180\% as they do in the data. Two distinct
               counterfactual experiments where approval standards remain the
               same throughout suggest that the increased availability of
               high-leverage loans prior to the crisis can explain between 40\%
               to 65\% of the initial rise in foreclosure rates. Furthermore, we

               fluctuate considerably over time, it is important to understand
               how these fluctuations affect households’ consumption decisions.
               Rising house prices may stimulate consumption by increasing
               households’ perceived wealth, or by relaxing borrowing
               constraints. This paper investigates the response of household
               consumption to house prices using UK micro data. We estimate the
               largest effect of house prices on consumption for older
               homeowners, and the smallest effect, insignificantly different
               from zero, for younger renters. This finding is consistent with
               heterogeneity in the wealth effect across these groups. In
               addition, we find that regional house prices affect regional
               consumption growth. Predictable changes in house prices are
               correlated with predictable changes in consumption, particularly
               for households that are more likely to be borrowing constrained,
               but this effect is driven by national rather than regional house
               prices and is important for renters as well as homeowners,

               1982 through 1999, to the thirty-one year period, 1978 through

               aggregate value of owner-occupied housing, the value of financial
               assets, and measures of aggregate consumption for each of the
               geographic units over time. We estimate regression models in
