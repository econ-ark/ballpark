# Prior Literature

The HKM&O (2017) paper sits on several strands of prior work. **Housing, wealth, and consumption:** Micro evidence showed that house prices affect spending in different ways for different households—e.g. Campbell and Cocco (2007) and Case, Quigley, and Shiller (2011) found important housing-wealth or collateral effects, while Attanasio et al. (2009) and Browning et al. (2013) stressed collateral/credit and common factors rather than a pure wealth effect. That heterogeneity in who responds to house prices and why is central to a "housing channel" of policy. **Heterogeneity and monetary transmission:** Work on hand-to-mouth and "wealthy hand-to-mouth" (Kaplan, Violante, and Weidner 2014), partial consumption insurance (Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston 2008; Kaplan and Violante 2010), and the redistribution channel of monetary policy (Di Maggio, Kermani, and Ramcharan 2014; Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima 2014) showed that differences in marginal propensities to consume and in exposure to interest rates and inflation are key for how monetary policy affects aggregate demand. **Housing and mortgages in general equilibrium:** Models with heterogeneous households, illiquid housing, default, and foreclosures—e.g. Jeske, Krueger, and Mitman (2013), Hedlund (2016), Corbae and Quintin (2015), and Favilukis (2010)—and "balance sheet recession" ideas (Huo and Ríos-Rull 2013) provided the tools to embed a frictional housing market and mortgage contracts in a macro model. Together, this literature gave the ingredients HKM&O use: a heterogeneous-agent framework where housing is illiquid and collateral matters, and where monetary policy works partly through the housing channel and redistribution, which their paper then formalizes in a single model.

**Key foundational papers:** Jeske, Krueger & Mitman (2013); Hedlund (2016); Kaplan & Violante (2010, 2014); Blundell, Pistaferri & Preston (2008); Campbell & Cocco (2007); Favilukis (2010); Di Maggio, Kermani & Ramcharan (2014). See `prior-literature.md` in this folder for details.

# Subsequent Literature

Work that cites HKM&O has taken several directions. The **refinancing and cash-flow channel** has been tested with regional and micro data: Beraja, Fuster, Hurst, and Vavra (QJE) use regional variation in mortgage structure and refinancing exposure; Wong ties the mechanism to population aging; and Cloyne, Ferreira, and Surico (REStud) provide direct evidence on how household debt alters the transmission of monetary policy. The literature has also embraced **micro heterogeneity for macro policy**—Kaplan and Violante (JEP) synthesize how heterogeneity in liquidity, debt, and MPC shapes the effects of monetary and other shocks—and **housing, credit, and macroprudential policy** (Funke et al., Koeniger et al., Pidkuyko). Central banks (Sveriges Riksbank, IMF) have framed the open question of whether higher household indebtedness has weakened monetary policy transmission. Open gaps remain: optimal monetary policy and welfare in HA-housing models; behavior at the ZLB and under unconventional policy; renters and tenure choice; structural estimation; and long-run distributional effects.

**Most important subsequent papers:** Beraja et al. (QJE), "Regional Heterogeneity and the Refinancing Channel of Monetary Policy"; Cloyne et al. (REStud), "Monetary Policy when Households have Debt"; Kaplan & Violante (JEP), "Microeconomic Heterogeneity and Macroeconomic Shocks." See `subsequent-literature-analysis.md` in this folder for the full analysis.

## Other improvements

- **Overview:** Add a **Contribution** bullet: *"First structural HA-NK model that jointly has heterogeneous households, a frictional housing market and mortgages, and nominal rigidities, to analyze how monetary policy transmits through the housing channel."*
- **Slideshow:** If using Jupyter slideshow, set `slide_type: "slide"` (or equivalent) on the Prior Literature and Subsequent Literature cells so they appear as distinct slides.
- **See also (optional):** At the end of the notebook, add a short line pointing to `prior-literature.md`, `subsequent-literature-analysis.md`, and `MP-Housing-Channel.bib` for full references and analysis.
