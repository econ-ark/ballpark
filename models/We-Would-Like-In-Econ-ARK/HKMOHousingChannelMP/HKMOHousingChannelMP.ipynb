        "The HKM&O (2017) paper sits on several strands of prior work. **Housing, wealth, and consumption:** Micro evidence showed that house prices affect spending in different ways for different households—e.g. Campbell and Cocco (2007) and Case, Quigley, and Shiller (2011) found important housing-wealth or collateral effects, while Attanasio et al. (2009) and Browning et al. (2013) stressed collateral/credit and common factors rather than a pure wealth effect. That heterogeneity in who responds to house prices and why is central to a \"housing channel\" of policy. **Heterogeneity and monetary transmission:** Work on hand-to-mouth and \"wealthy hand-to-mouth\" (Kaplan, Violante, and Weidner 2014), partial consumption insurance (Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston 2008; Kaplan and Violante 2010), and the redistribution channel of monetary policy (Di Maggio, Kermani, and Ramcharan 2014; Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima 2014) showed that differences in marginal propensities to consume and in exposure to interest rates and inflation are key for how monetary policy affects aggregate demand. **Housing and mortgages in general equilibrium:** Models with heterogeneous households, illiquid housing, default, and foreclosures—e.g. Jeske, Krueger, and Mitman (2013), Hedlund (2016), Corbae and Quintin (2015), and Favilukis (2010)—and \"balance sheet recession\" ideas (Huo and Ríos-Rull 2013) provided the tools to embed a frictional housing market and mortgage contracts in a macro model. Together, this literature gave the ingredients HKM&O use: a heterogeneous-agent framework where housing is illiquid and collateral matters, and where monetary policy works partly through the housing channel and redistribution, which their paper then formalizes in a single model.\n",

The **refinancing and cash-flow channel** has been tested with regional and micro data: Beraja, Fuster, Hurst, and Vavra (QJE) use regional variation in mortgage structure and refinancing exposure; Wong ties the mechanism to population aging; and Cloyne, Ferreira, and Surico (REStud) provide direct evidence on how household debt alters the transmission of monetary policy. The literature has also embraced **micro heterogeneity for macro policy**—Kaplan and Violante (JEP) synthesize how heterogeneity in liquidity, debt, and MPC shapes the effects of monetary and other shocks—and **housing, credit, and macroprudential policy** (Funke et al., Koeniger et al., Pidkuyko). Central banks (Sveriges Riksbank, IMF) have framed the open question of whether higher household indebtedness has weakened monetary policy transmission. Open gaps remain: optimal monetary policy and welfare in HA-housing models; behavior at the ZLB and under unconventional policy; renters and tenure choice; structural estimation; and long-run distributional effects.\n",
