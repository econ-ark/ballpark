        "* A HA model with uninsurable aggregate and idiosyncratic risk exhibits a larger effect of a real exchange rate depreciation via two channels: the real income channel and the multiplier channel.\n",
        "\n",
        "* With low trade elasticity, the two channels can dominate the consumption switching channel, leading to contractionary depreciation.\n",

        "* The model shows contrasting monetary policy responses to a foreign exchange rate hike in emerging economies and advanced economies.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Open-economy New Keynesian foundations** ({cite:t}`Obstfeld1995-wg`; {cite:t}`Gali2004-kj`) supply the small open economy with nominal rigidities, terms-of-trade and expenditure-switching effects, and the link between exchange rates and aggregate demand; {cite:t}`Clarida2002-gd` and {cite:t}`Corsetti2001-dc` add international transmission. \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Heterogeneous-agent monetary transmission** ({cite:t}`Kaplan2018-to`; {cite:t}`Auclert2019-js`; {cite:t}`McKay2016-ss`; {cite:t}`Werning2015-vz`) supplies the micro structure: in HANK the main channel from rates to consumption is indirect (general equilibrium labor demand) and redistribution (earnings heterogeneity, Fisher, interest rate exposure) interacts with MPC heterogeneity. \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Exchange rates, real income, and redistribution** ({cite:t}`Laursen1950-jl`; {cite:t}`Krugman1978-yz`; {cite:t}`Diaz-Alejandro1963-zf`; {cite:t}`Lane2010-fu`; {cite:t}`Cravino2016-hl`; {cite:t}`de-Ferra2020-ai`; {cite:t}`Bems2016-us`) tie the two together. Together these strands make it possible to study how exchange rate movements alter real incomes and redistribute across agents with different MPCs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prior work had either open-economy models with a real income channel but no heterogeneity, or HANK with redistribution but no open-economy structure. The real income channel had therefore never been **sized** in a model with both. This paper builds a tractable open-economy HANK and uses it to size up the real income channel (including its redistribution/MPC dimension) relative to other channels."
