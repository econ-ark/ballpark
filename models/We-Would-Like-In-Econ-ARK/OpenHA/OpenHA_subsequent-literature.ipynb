They show that the mechanisms identified by {cite:t}`Auclert2021-ki` — the real income and multiplier channels — are quantitatively large in countries with high import dependence and concentrated income distributions.\n",

Building on the open-economy HANK framework of {cite:t}`Auclert2021-ki`, they show that devaluations disproportionately hurt lower-income households through import price increases, and that this distributional channel feeds back into aggregate dynamics.\n",
