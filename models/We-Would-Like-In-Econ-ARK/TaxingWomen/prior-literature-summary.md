# Prior Literature Summary: Taxing Women: A Macroeconomic Analysis (2012)

## The papers my ballpark paper cites

This paper builds on the optimal income taxation tradition initiated by Mirrlees (1971), which formalized how nonlinear tax schedules trade off redistribution against labor-supply distortions. Applied to families, classic work on the optimal taxation of couples and the normative case against treating spouses symmetrically—especially Boskin and Sheshinski (1983), and the broader debate over joint filing and income splitting (Rosen 1977; Kesselman 2008; McCaffery 2007)—highlighted a key efficiency idea: because secondary earners (often married women) tend to have more elastic labor supply, efficient tax systems generally imply lower marginal tax rates on the secondary earner than on the primary earner. Related theoretical work on taxing couples as a screening problem (The optimal income taxation of couples) and on moving beyond “unitary” household models to analyze intra-household allocation (Apps and Rees 1988, 2007) clarified why the design of family taxation interacts with participation choices and within-family behavior.

A second foundation is the empirical and quantitative literature on female labor supply, particularly the importance of the extensive margin and its evolution over time. Reviews and surveys (Blundell and MaCurdy 1998; Keane 2010) and evidence on changing married women’s elasticities and participation trends (Heim 2007; Blau and Kahn 2007) motivated models that can match participation responses to taxes. Life-cycle quantitative work explaining cohort changes in women’s labor supply via child costs and the gender wage gap (Attanasio, Low, and Sánchez-Marcos 2008) and macro frameworks where family structure generates different elasticities via fixed costs/participation (Cho and Rogerson 1988) made it feasible to embed realistic female labor-supply behavior in general equilibrium. This paper is especially enabled by the authors’ own life-cycle, heterogeneous-household quantitative approach to tax reforms and married female participation (Guner, Kaygusuz, and Ventura 2012), which provides a calibrated macro platform for evaluating how alternative family-tax designs reallocate distortions and aggregate labor supply.

## Key foundational papers

- Mirrlees (1971), "An exploration in the theory of optimum income taxation": Provides the core optimal-tax framework (redistribution vs. labor-supply distortions) that later couple/household taxation results extend.
- Boskin and Sheshinski (1983), "Optimal tax treatment of the family: Married couples": Establishes the central efficiency result that secondary earners should generally face lower marginal tax rates, linking optimal family taxation to own/cross elasticities and the joint wage distribution.
- Guner, Kaygusuz, and Ventura (2012), "Taxation and Household Labour Supply": Supplies the modern quantitative life-cycle/general-equilibrium framework with heterogeneous households and an operative extensive margin needed to evaluate realistic tax reforms and married female labor-supply responses.
