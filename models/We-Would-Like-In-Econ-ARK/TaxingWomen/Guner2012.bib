               elasticities and the joint distribution of wage rates. Our
               results suggest that the current system of income splitting in
               the United States, under which husbands and wives face equal
               marginal tax rates, is nonoptimal. Using results from recent
               econometric studies, and allowing for a sensitivity analysis, the
               optimal tax rates on secondary workers in the family are much
               lower than those on primary earners. Indeed, our best estimate is
               that the secondary earner would face tax rates only one-half as

               participation of married females across skill groups, children,
               and the structure of marital sorting. We concentrate on two
               revenue-neutral tax reforms: a proportional income tax and a
               reform in which married individuals file taxes separately
               (separate filing). Our findings indicate that tax reforms are
               accompanied by large increases in labour supply that differ
               across demographic groups, with the bulk of the increase coming
               from married females. Under a proportional income tax reform,
               married females account for more than 50\% of the changes in
               hours across steady states, while under separate filing reform,

              couples, a multidimensional screening problem. Each couple
              consists of a primary earner who always participates in the labor
              market, but makes an hours-of-work choice, and a secondary earner
              who chooses whether or not to work. If second-earner participation
              is a signal of the couple being better (worse) off, we prove that
              optimal tax schemes display a positive tax (subsidy) on secondary
              earnings and that the tax (subsidy) on secondary earnings
              decreases with primary earnings and converges to zero
              asymptotically. We present calibrated microsimulations for the
              United Kingdom showing that decreasing tax rates on secondary
              earnings is quantitatively significant and consistent with actual
