## What the subsequent literature tells us

The subsequent literature pushes “taxation + household labor supply” into broader **quantitative macro–public finance** agendas: cross-country comparisons of how tax/transfer systems shape married couples’ labor supply (Bick and Fuchs-Schündeln 2018; related long-run evidence in Bick et al. 2018), and a growing set of life-cycle/OLG models that use rich household heterogeneity to evaluate redistributive reforms (e.g., Bucciol et al. 2017; Braun, Kopecky, and Koreshkova 2016). A prominent direction is to treat family policy as an integrated package—income taxes, child-related transfers, childcare subsidies, and Social Security rules—because the participation/earnings responses of secondary earners amplify or undo intended redistribution (Kaygusuz 2015; Nishiyama 2019; Guner, Kaygusuz, and Ventura 2020; Guner, Kaygusuz, and Ventura 2014).

On the frontier, the field is increasingly connecting **gender gaps and family structure** to macro wedges via mechanisms beyond a reduced-form “secondary earner elasticity”: household production and time allocation (Duernecker and Herrendorf 2018), childcare/children costs (Guner, Kaygusuz, and Ventura 2020), and broader gender-gap accounting across industrialized countries (Olivetti and Petrongolo 2016; Ponthieux and Meurs 2015). In parallel, modern “road map” work in heterogeneous-agent taxation clarifies the state variables and sufficient statistics that matter for designing efficient tax systems in dynamic settings (Karabarbounis 2016; see also life-cycle optimal tax perspectives like Gorry and Oberfield 2012). This combination is making the research agenda more structural (explicit life-cycle and family choices), more comparative (across countries and over time), and more policy-relevant (bundles of taxes and transfers rather than isolated reforms).

Key gaps remain. First, many quantitative models still rely on simplified representations of **intra-household decision-making** (unitary vs bargaining) and **home production/childcare technology**, even though these margins likely drive the gender-specific elasticities that justify differentiated tax treatment. Second, linking macro models to micro data is still hard: credible identification of tax/transfer reforms, measurement of effective marginal tax rates for couples, and mapping of time-use/childcare constraints into model primitives. Third, cross-country work needs tighter harmonization of institutions and micro moments to distinguish “policy effects” from differences in norms, childcare markets, and wage structures. To contribute, a researcher typically needs (i) a life-cycle heterogeneous-household macro framework with married/single structure and an extensive margin, (ii) institutional knowledge of tax-transfer rules that generate couple-level wedges, and (iii) empirical discipline—using participation/earnings elasticities, time-use moments, and reform-based variation—to pin down the mechanisms that drive secondary-earner responses.

## Most important subsequent papers

1. Bick and Fuchs-Schündeln (2018), "Taxation and Labor Supply of Married Couples across Countries: A Macroeconomic Analysis": Sets the agenda for cross-country, quantitative evaluation of how family tax wedges map into married couples’ (especially secondary-earner) labor supply, turning the question into a comparative macro measurement-and-modeling program.
2. Karabarbounis (2016), "A Road Map for Efficiently Taxing Heterogeneous Agents": Synthesizes cutting-edge insights on designing efficient tax systems in heterogeneous-agent macro settings, helping clarify which moments and state variables matter when extending family-tax questions to richer dynamic environments.
3. Guner, Kaygusuz, and Ventura (2020), "Child-Related Transfers, Household Labour Supply, and Welfare": Shows where the policy frontier moved—beyond filing status to the joint design of child-related transfers and labor-supply incentives—highlighting that family policy and labor supply must be analyzed as a package to assess welfare and distributional trade-offs.
