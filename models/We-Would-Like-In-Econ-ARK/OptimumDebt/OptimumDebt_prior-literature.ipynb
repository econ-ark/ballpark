    "## Prior Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "Aiyagari & McGrattan’s analysis of the welfare effects of government debt sits at the intersection of (i) **incomplete-markets macro** with idiosyncratic risk and borrowing constraints and (ii) **normative public finance** where debt is financed by taxes that can be distortionary. In this environment, public debt is not just a financing tool: it can function as a **liquid safe asset** that relaxes households’ self-insurance constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual building blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incomplete markets + precautionary saving**: With uninsured idiosyncratic risk and borrowing constraints, households accumulate assets for self-insurance. {cite:t}`Bewley1983-lj`\n",
    "- **Quantitative heterogeneous-agent GE**: Embeds the Bewley logic in a full production economy and characterizes the induced wealth distribution and aggregate saving. {cite:t}`Aiyagari1994-kq`\n",
    "- **Debt as liquidity (failure of Ricardian equivalence)**: When some agents are liquidity constrained, higher public debt can raise welfare by increasing the share of liquid assets in private portfolios. {cite:t}`Woodford1990-ze`\n",
    "- **Fiscal costs via optimal taxation**: Debt has to be serviced; financing via taxes can create efficiency costs that are central in normative evaluation. {cite:t}`Chamley1986-pw`\n",
    "- **Representative-agent benchmark**: Ricardian equivalence provides the baseline that breaks once borrowing constraints / market incompleteness are introduced. {cite:t}`Barro1979-px`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What {cite:t}`aiyagari1998` adds\n",
    "\n",
    "The prior literature establishes the mechanisms (liquidity benefits vs. fiscal/tax costs), but it does not pin down **how large** the welfare gains are or **which debt level** is optimal in a calibrated heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium model. {cite:t}`aiyagari1998` combines the above ingredients to quantify the optimal debt-to-output ratio and the welfare loss from being away from the optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key foundational papers (what to remember)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{cite:t}`Bewley1983-lj`** — *A difficulty with the optimum quantity of money*: Introduces the canonical self-insurance framework with idiosyncratic risk and borrowing constraints. It explains why liquidity constraints generate precautionary saving and a non-degenerate wealth distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{cite:t}`Aiyagari1994-kq`** — *Uninsured idiosyncratic risk and aggregate saving*: Provides a quantitative general equilibrium version of the Bewley framework with production. It supplies the computational/GE backbone that later papers (including {cite:t}`aiyagari1998`) use for calibrated welfare comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{cite:t}`Woodford1990-ze`** — *Public debt as private liquidity*: Makes the key point that public debt can improve efficiency by supplying liquidity when private credit is imperfect. This motivates why more debt can raise welfare for constrained households even if it must be repaid through future taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{cite:t}`Chamley1986-pw`** — *Optimal taxation of capital income in general equilibrium*: A benchmark for thinking about distortionary tax financing in dynamic GE. It motivates treating debt policy as a welfare problem with potentially important long-run tax wedges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{cite:t}`Barro1979-px`** — *On the determination of the public debt*: The representative-agent Ricardian benchmark. Its assumptions highlight exactly what incomplete markets and borrowing constraints change in the debt-welfare analysis.\n",
