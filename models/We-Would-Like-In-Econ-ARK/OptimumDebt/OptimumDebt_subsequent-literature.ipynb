    "## Subsequent Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the publication of {cite:t}`aiyagari1998`, a substantial body of work has extended the core insight that government debt can serve as a welfare-improving liquid asset in economies with heterogeneous, borrowing-constrained households. The papers below all cite {cite:t}`aiyagari1998` and push the analysis in new directions. We organize them into four broad themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Joint fiscal–monetary policy design\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`aiyagari1998` focused on the fiscal side: how much debt should the government issue, given the trade-off between liquidity benefits and tax costs? A natural next step is to ask how **monetary policy** interacts with that trade-off when households are heterogeneous.\n",
    "\n",
    "- {cite:t}`optimal_bilbiie_2020` study optimal monetary policy in an economy where households differ in their access to liquidity. They show that the central bank's interest-rate policy has distributional consequences that a representative-agent model misses, because changes in the real rate alter the value of the government's outstanding debt as a liquid store of value.\n",
    "- {cite:t}`optimal_grand_2021` extend this further to **joint** fiscal and monetary policy, asking what combination of debt, taxes, and interest rates maximizes welfare when agents are heterogeneous. Their work highlights that the instruments are complementary: the optimal debt level depends on how aggressively monetary policy is used, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Optimal public debt: new models and quantitative updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Several papers revisit the optimal-debt question itself with richer model ingredients or updated calibrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- {cite:t}`optimal_chatterjee_2017` provide an explicit \"redux\" of the optimal public debt problem, incorporating productive public expenditure alongside the liquidity and tax channels in {cite:t}`aiyagari1998`. They find that the optimal debt-to-output ratio can shift substantially when government spending is productive rather than purely wasteful.\n",
    "- {cite:t}`32_derasmo_2016` take a broader perspective on debt sustainability, asking not just \"what is optimal?\" but \"what is sustainable?\" in models with default risk and heterogeneous agents. This connects the normative question in {cite:t}`aiyagari1998` to the positive question of sovereign debt crises.\n",
    "- {cite:t}`public_kaas_2016` examines how public debt crowds out private capital and affects total factor productivity when firms, not just households, face financial frictions. This adds a supply-side channel that {cite:t}`aiyagari1998` abstracted from.\n",
    "- {cite:t}`welfareimproving_viegas_2013` analyze welfare-improving government behavior in a heterogeneous-agent model, showing that the distributional consequences of debt policy depend critically on the joint distribution of wealth and productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Distributional effects and targeted policy\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurring lesson from {cite:t}`aiyagari1998` is that aggregate welfare numbers can mask large differences across household types. Later work makes this distributional dimension the central object of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- {cite:t}`targeted_chakrabarti_2021` study targeted fiscal interventions and show that consumption dynamics and welfare gains differ sharply across the wealth distribution. Their results underscore that *who* receives the liquidity benefit of public debt matters as much as the aggregate level.\n",
    "- {cite:t}`politics_carroll_2021` bring political economy into the picture. Even if the planner's optimal debt level is well-defined, actual policy emerges from a political process. They analyze how tax-structure preferences vary across the wealth distribution and how this shapes equilibrium fiscal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Computational methods for heterogeneous-agent optimal policy\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical barrier to extending {cite:t}`aiyagari1998` has been computational: solving for optimal policy in HA models—especially along transition paths—is hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "- {cite:t}`optimal_legrand_2023` develop truncation and approximation methods that make it feasible to compute optimal policies with transitions in large-scale HA economies. This is important because {cite:t}`aiyagari1998` characterized the optimal *steady-state* debt level, but policy-makers also need guidance on how to *get there* from the current level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent literature takes the welfare trade-off in {cite:t}`aiyagari1998`—liquidity benefits for constrained households versus tax/crowding-out costs—and enriches it along four dimensions: (i) adding monetary policy as a complementary instrument, (ii) introducing richer fiscal channels (productive spending, default risk, firm frictions), (iii) foregrounding distributional and political-economy considerations, and (iv) developing the computational tools needed to study transition dynamics. Together, these contributions show that the \"optimum quantity of debt\" remains a productive research question more than two decades after the original paper.\n",
