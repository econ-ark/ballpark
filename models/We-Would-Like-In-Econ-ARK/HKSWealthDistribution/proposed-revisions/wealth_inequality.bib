              inequality in the United States. While there is a large number of
              existing theories of the Pareto tail of the long-run income
              distributions, almost none of these address the fast rise in top
              inequality observed in the data. We show that standard theories,
              which build on a random growth mechanism, generate transition
              dynamics that are an order of magnitude too slow relative to those
              observed in the data. We then suggest two parsimonious deviations
              from the canonical model that can explain such changes: ``scale
              dependence'' that may arise from changes in skill prices, and
              ``type dependence,'' i.e. the presence of some ``high-growth
              types.'' These deviations are consistent with theories in which
              the increase in top income inequality is driven by the rise of
              ``superstar'' entrepreneurs or managers."

               capitalizing the incomes reported by individual taxpayers,
               accounting for assets that do not generate taxable income. We
               successfully test our capitalization method in three micro
               datasets where we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey
               of Consumer Finance, linked estate and income tax returns, and
               foundations’ tax records. We find that wealth concentration was
               high in the beginning of the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to
               1978, and has continuously increased since then. The top 0.1\%
               wealth share has risen from 7\% in 1978 to 22\% in 2012, a level
               almost as high as in 1929. Top wealth-holders are younger today
               than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of the economy’s
               labor income. The bottom 90\% wealth share first increased up to
               the mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth

               very top income groups. We include individual and corporate
               income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes. The
               progressivity of the U.S. federal tax system at the top of the
               income distribution has declined dramatically since the 1960s.
               This dramatic drop in progressivity is due primarily to a drop in
               corporate taxes and in estate and gift taxes combined with a
               sharp change in the composition of top incomes away from capital
               income and toward labor income. The sharp drop in statutory top
               marginal individual income tax rates has contributed only
               moderately to the decline in tax progressivity. International
               comparisons confirm that is it critical to take into account
               other taxes than the individual income tax to properly assess the
               extent of overall tax progressivity, both for time trends and for

               experienced an increase in tax progressivity and has now a more

               income inequality is for the most part a capital income

               major shocks during the 1914-45 period, and were never able to

               Introducing credit rationing into the Solow model modifies these

               distributions can exist because higher initial rates can be

               heterogeneity arises from uninsurable and idiosyncratic
               uncertainty in preferences and employment status. We calibrate
               the model to match the distribution of wealth in U.S. data and
               features of transitions between employment and unemployment. In
               comparison with much of the literature, we find rather large
               effects. For our benchmark model, we find welfare effects that,
               on average across all consumers, are of a bit more than one order
               of magnitude larger than those computed by Lucas [Lucas Jr.,
               R.E., 1987. Models of Business Cycles. Basil Blackwell, New
               York]. When we distinguish long- from short-term unemployment,
               long-term unemployment being distinguished by poor (and highly
               procyclical) employment prospects and low unemployment
               compensation, the average gain from eliminating cycles is as much
               as 1\% in consumption equivalents. In addition, in both models,
               there are large differences across groups: very poor consumers
               gain a lot when cycles are removed (the long-term unemployed as
               much as around 30\%), as do very rich consumers, whereas the
               majority of consumers—the “middle class”—sees much smaller gains
               from removing cycles. Inequality also rises substantially upon

               The three main approaches—the Survey of Consumer Finances, estate
               tax multiplier, and capitalization methods—generate generally
               consistent findings until mid-1980s but diverge since then, with
               the capitalization method showing a dramatic increase in wealth
               concentration and the other two methods showing at best a small
               increase. I discuss strengths and weaknesses of different
               approaches. The increase in capitalization estimates since 2000
               is driven by a dramatic and puzzling increase in fixed income
               assets. There is evidence that estate tax estimates may not be
               sufficiently accounting for mortality improvements over time. The
               nonresponse and coverage issues in the SCF are a concern. I
               conclude that the changing nature of top incomes and the
               increased importance of self-made wealth may explain difficulties
               in implementing each of the methods and why the results diverge.",

               the global labor share has significantly declined since the early

               results. First, individuals earn markedly different average
               returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1\%) and
               on its components. Second, heterogeneity in returns does not
               arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between
               safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even within
               narrow asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated
               with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the
               net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage
               points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net‐of‐tax
               returns). Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial
               persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence
               partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets
               scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and
               financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent.
               Finally, wealth returns are correlated across generations. We

               shares are substantial and increasing rapidly (Piketty and Saez

               administrative data to measure top shares is to overcome the
               under-representation of families at the very top that plagues
               most household surveys. However, using tax records alone
               restricts the unit of analysis for measuring economic resources,
               limits the concepts of income and wealth being measured, and
               imposes a rigid correlation between income and wealth. The Survey
               of Consumer Finances (SCF) solves the under-representation
               problem by combining administrative and survey data (Bricker et
               al, 2014). Administrative records are used to select the SCF
               sample and verify that high-end families are appropriately
               represented, and the survey is designed to measure comprehensive
               concepts of income and wealth at the family level. The SCF shows
               high and rising top income and wealth shares, as in the ad
               ministrative tax data. However, unadjusted, the levels and growth
               based on administrative tax data alone appear to be substantially

               restrictions and rigidities needed to estimate top income and
               wealth shares in the administrative data bias up levels and

               during the past sixty years. Furthermore, the recent increase in

               introduction of these technologies profitable. On the other hand,
               the twentieth-century has been characterized by skill-biased
