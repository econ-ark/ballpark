# Prior Literature Summary: A Comprehensive Quantitative Theory of the U.S. Wealth Distribution

## The papers my ballpark paper cites

This literature can be summarized in three parts. First, standard incomplete-markets models in the Bewley–Aiyagari tradition show how uninsurable risk and borrowing constraints generate precautionary saving and inequality, but they cannot explain why wealth is much more concentrated than income. Second, later studies extend these models by introducing return risk, entrepreneurship, and wealth-dependent returns, which help generate fat-tailed wealth distributions consistent with theory. Third, empirical work documents long-run U.S. wealth and income inequality and provides quantitative methods, motivating a comprehensive model that combines heterogeneity, risk, and return differences.


## Key foundational papers

- Aiyagari (1994) “Uninsured idiosyncratic risk and aggregate saving”: Establishes the standard incomplete-markets model with precautionary saving and borrowing constraints that serves as the baseline framework.
- Krusell & Smith (1998) “Income and wealth heterogeneity in the macroeconomy”: Develops the main quantitative method for solving heterogeneous-agent models with aggregate dynamics.
- Stachurski & Toda (2018) “An impossibility theorem for wealth in heterogeneous-agent models with limited heterogeneity”: Proves that standard Bewley–Aiyagari models (infinite-lived agents, risk-free saving, constant discount factors) cannot generate a heavier tail for wealth than for income. This forces the kind of extensions (return risk, entrepreneurship, etc.) that the 2018 paper uses.
- Benhabib, Bisin & Zhu (2015) “The wealth distribution in Bewley economies with capital income risk”: Shows that introducing idiosyncratic capital income risk generates a Pareto-tailed wealth distribution.
- Cagetti & De Nardi (2006) “Entrepreneurship, frictions, and wealth”: Provides a foundational model of entrepreneurship and borrowing constraints that explains top wealth concentration.
Piketty & Saez (2003) “Income inequality in the United States, 1913–1998”: Documents long-run trends in top income shares in the United States.
Saez & Zucman (2016) “Wealth inequality in the United States since 1913”: Constructs comprehensive long-run data on U.S. wealth inequality that serves as the main empirical benchmark.
