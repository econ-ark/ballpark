## What the subsequent literature tells us

The subsequent literature shows that ideas of the model used in "HKS" paper are increasingly used for policy analysis, especially to study how monetary and fiscal policies affect different parts of the wealth distribution, rather than only matching inequality patterns. At the same time, new empirical and theoretical work strengthens these models by disciplining saving and return behavior with micro data and by providing deeper foundations for income risk and discount-factor heterogeneity. More recent studies also introduce new channels such as market power and beliefs, suggesting that future research needs to integrate multiple mechanisms to better explain changes in wealth inequality.

## Most important subsequent papers

1. Fagereng, Holm, Moll & Natvik (2019) “Saving Behavior Across the Wealth Distribution: The Importance of Capital Gains”: Puts empirical structure on saving and returns by wealth. Critical for validating and refining the mechanisms that generate the right tail in HKS.
2. Boar & Midrigan (2019) “Markups and Inequality”: Shifts the focus from individual saving and income to how market power and product market structure shape inequality, broadening the agenda to firm- and market-driven sources of wealth concentration.
3. Ma, Stachurski & Toda (2019) “The income fluctuation problem and the evolution of wealth” (JET): Provides theoretical link from the income fluctuation problem to the evolution and shape of the wealth distribution. Clarifies when and how HKS-style dynamics arise from first principles.
