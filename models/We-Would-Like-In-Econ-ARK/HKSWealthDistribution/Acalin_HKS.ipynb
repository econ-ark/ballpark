This is motivated by the fact that register data in Norway and Sweden (see Fagereng et al. (2015) and Bach et al. (2015)) have revealed, first, an average return that is increasing in the household’s overall level of wealth; and, second, an idiosyncratic return component (because different households hold different types of assets) whose variance is also increasing in wealth.\n",

        "One major finding is that, once portfolio heterogeneity, calibrated to the findings in Bach et al. (2015), is incorporated into the model, the authors replicate wealth inequality of the magnitude we see in the data. Given the role of portfolio heterogeneity and of asset-price movements, it is important to think more about the origins of these observations. This paper is an important step forward in noting just how important portfolios and asset prices are for inequality.\n"

        "Declining tax progressivity, together with increasing earnings risk and higher earnings inequality amongst top earnings, can account for the rise in the capital-to-net-output ratio and at least some of the decline in the (gross) labor share when the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is larger than one as in Karabarbounis & Neiman (2014b). This model thus provides an alternative to the central mechanism—declining growth rates—to which Piketty (2014) draws attention in attempting to connect these macroeconomic trends to rising inequality.\n",

        "* (ii) Empirical discipline: Micro evidence on saving and returns by wealth (e.g. Fagereng, Holm, Moll & Natvik 2019 on capital gains across the wealth distribution) is used to validate and refine the mechanisms that generate the right tail. \n",
        "* (iii) New channels and theory: Markups and market power (Boar & Midrigan 2019), culture and portfolios (Fleck & Monninger 2020), and deeper theory for income-fluctuation problems and state-dependent discounting (Ma, Stachurski & Toda 2019; Stachurski & Zhang 2019) extend the framework. Together, this suggests the field is heading toward policy-relevant, empirically disciplined models that integrate multiple mechanisms."
