                 aggregation result under extreme illiquidity (no borrowing and
                 no outside assets), deriving a generalized Euler relation
                 involving the real interest rate, current and future aggregate
                 consumption. This provides a tractable way of incorporating
                 incomplete markets in macroeconomic models, dealing only with
                 aggregates. Although this relation does not necessarily
                 coincide with the standard representative-agent Euler equation,
                 I show that it does for an important benchmark specification.
                 When this is the case, idiosyncratic uncertainty and incomplete
                 markets leave their imprint by affecting the discount factor in
                 this representation, but the sensitivity of consumption to
                 current and future interest rates is unaffected. An immediate
                 corollary is that “forward guidance” (lower future interest
                 rates) is as powerful as in representative agent models. I show
                 that the same representation holds with positive liquidity
                 (borrowing and outside assets) when utility is logarithmic. I
                 show that away from these benchmark cases, consumption is
                 likely to become more sensitive to interest rate, and
                 especially future interest rates. Finally, I apply my approach

               that incomplete pass-through renders the analysis of monetary
               policy of an open economy fundamentally different from the one of
               a closed economy, unlike canonical models with perfect
               pass-through which emphasize a type of isomorphism. Second, and
               in response to efficient productivity shocks, incomplete
               pass-through has the effect of generating endogenously a
               short-run tradeoff between the stabilization of inflation and of
               the output gap. This holds independently of the measure of
               inflation being targeted by the monetary authority. Third, in
               studying the optimal program under commitment relative to
               discretion, we show that the former entails a smoothing of the
               deviations from the law of one price, in stark contrast with the
               established empirical evidence. In addition, an optimal

               heterogeneous-agent models with aggregate uncertainty. The idea
               relies on an assumption that linearization offers a good
               approximation; we share this assumption with existing
               linearization methods. However, unlike those methods, the
               approach here does not rely on direct derivation of first-order
               Taylor terms. It also does not use recursive methods, whereby
               aggregates and prices would be expressed as linear functions of
               the state, usually a very high-dimensional object (such as the
               wealth distribution). Rather, we rely merely on solving
               nonlinearly for a deterministic transition path: we study the
               equilibrium response to a single, small “MIT shock” carefully. We
               then regard this impulse response path as a numerical derivative
               in sequence space and hence provide our linearized solution
               directly using this path. The method can easily be extended to
               the case of many shocks and computation time rises linearly in
               the number of shocks. We also propose a set of checks on whether
               linearization is a good approximation. We assert that our method
               is the simplest and most transparent linearization technique
               among currently known methods. The key numerical tool required to
               implement it is value-function iteration, using a very limited
               set of state variables.This article is part of a Special Issue

                 This paper shows that even in a simple ``off-the-shelf''
                 industrial organization model, this assumption is unfounded; if
                 market-entry costs are sunk, exchange rate shocks can alter

                 effects. In other words, a sufficiently large exchange rate

                 This simple idea has strong implications for exchange rate
                 theory (Baldwin and Krugman 1986 shows this), for trade policy
                 (Dixit 1987a discusses this), and for the estimation of trade
