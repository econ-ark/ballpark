    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tagging multiple characteristics to obtain optimal tax policies  \n",
    "* While previous studies such as Guner et al. (2012) focuses on a single characteristic tag to determine optimal tax policies, this paper uses three tags, namely age, household assets and filing status, jointly in order to asses if these tags are substitutes or complements within the optimal policy.  \n",
    "* This paper also contributes by analyzing the relation between human capital accumulation and optimal taxation. The  introduction of human capital accummulation allows a better estimation of the hump shape of age-dependent taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-technical methodological overview  \n",
    "The primary experiment of this paper replaces the prevailing labor income tax at that time with a revenue-neutral labor income tax system that depends separately or jointly on age, household assets and filing status with an objective to optimize welfare of new household at the new steady state. The model used is an OLG economy with an endogenous savings and labor supply decisions with an incomplete asset market and a government that is operating a balanced pay-as-you go Social Security system.  \n",
    "The problem is solved in two stages. First, for a given set of instruments, the competitive equilibrium allocations which also satisfies the government budget constraint is solved. In the second stage, the tax parameters are then iterated over to find the set which maximizes the social welfare function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregate Effects of Reforms  \n",
    "Overall, a tax policy applying all three optimal tags would increase consumption by 6.4%, labor supply by 2.7%, capital by 19.7% and welfare by 1.5%. Age dependent taxes nudges hours of work towards younger ages and allows older workers to work almost as much as they do without the optimal tax in place. Furthermore, filing status increases female working hours without reducing male hours significantly."

    "## The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demographics  \n",
    "The economy is populated by a continuum of households consisting of a male (m) and female (f) member with the same age and a total of J overlapping generation. Each household obtains utility from consumption and leisure. They are endowned with a unit of productive time which they split between work $h^m$ and leisure $h^f$. Households members also face an exogenous probability of losing their jobs denoted by $\\lambda^m$ and $\\lambda^f$ for male and female members respectively. Working members also pay a fixed cost $FC_j$ to work every period, which is expressed in utility terms and depends on age. Nonemployed members also have to pay an extra cost to work, which is rationalized as a search cost $sc_j$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Human Capital Accumulation  \n",
    "The model allows endogenous human capital accumulation for both genders with a higher level of working experience ($\\kappa$) implying a higher productivity component ($\\epsilon$). Experience and productivity are related through the following function\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$log \\ \\epsilon^i (\\kappa) \\ = \\ \\chi_1 log(1 \\ + \\ \\chi_0^i \\ + \\ \\gamma(\\kappa \\ - \\ 1))$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "$\\chi_0^i$ depends on gender to reflect the average wage differences between males and females with equal experience and $\\gamma$ is a scale parameter involving the number of grid points set for $\\kappa$ and the maximum amount of working years.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Productivity  \n",
    "Each period, household members receive wages $\\hat{w}$ depending on the market wage $w$, their skill $z$ and experience $\\kappa$ and a persistent idiosyncratic shock $x$ with skills distributed across households as $log(z) \\sim N(0, \\sigma_z^2)$ where booth household member share the same level of skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asset Market and Borrowing Constraints  \n",
    "The asset market is incomplete supporting the evidence that consumption responds to income change. Furthermore, the set of financial instruments is restricted to risk free assets $a$, which costs 1 consumption unit at time $y$ and pays $(1 \\ + \\ r)$ at time $t \\ + \\ 1)$. The real interest rate r is determined endogenously in the model. Households are allowed to borrow up to a limit $\\underline(a)$ which affects labor response. Agents saves for three reasons, namely:\n",

    "$$C \\ + \\ (n \\ + \\ \\delta )K \\ + G \\ = \\ f(K,L)$$\n",

    "  \n",
    "### Government  \n",
    "The government oeprates a balanced pay-as-you-go Social Security (ss) system and households receives the ss benefits that are independent of the contributions they give an are finance by a proportional labor taxes $\\tau_ss$. The payroll tax is exogenous. Furthermore, the government taxes consumption, capital and labor to finance their expenditure. Consumption tax $\\tau_c$ and capital income tax $\\tau_k$ are proportional and exogenous.  \n",
    "Tax rates are computed based on total pre-tax labor earnings  $W \\ = \\ \\hat{w}^m h^m \\ + \\hat{w}^f h^f$ where $\\hat{w} \\ = \\ wz\\epsilon x$. Tax rates also depends on the filing status $\\mathcal{F}$, with households filing as single (S) or joint (J). The tax schedule is nonlinear and has the form:  \n",

    "### Household's Problem  \n",
    "Households are indexed by their skill type and age $(z, j)$. State variables are the household's asset holdings a, the stochastic productivity components of its members $\\textbf{x}^i \\ = \\ \\{ x^m, x^f \\}$, labor market experience $\\kappa \\ = \\ \\{ \\kappa^m, \\ \\kappa^f \\}$ and the previous employment status of each member $\\textbf{E}_{-1} \\ = \\ \\{ E_{-1}^m, \\ E_{-1}^f \\}$.  \n",

    "The main findings are as follows:  \n",
    "* Average tax rates are hump shaped in age. A two earner households with an average income of \\$86,509 pays 19$ in income taxes in the benchmark economy while the simulation using all tags results at a 2% rate at age 25, 26% in age 45 and 24%  at age 65.\n",
    "* Average tax rates decreases in hosehold assets. Optimal taxation shows interaction among age and assets, with atx rate decreasing only for wealthier households close to retirement age.\n",
    "* Households with two earners faces a lower rate relative to single-earners. Single earners in the optimal system pays 23.8% while joint files pay 18.6%. Filing status is neither susbstitutes nor complements of the other two tags.\n",

    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Optimal labor income taxes are hump shaped in age, are lower for households where both couple are working and decreasing\n",

    "The paper also found that age and asset to be complimentary in that, when combined as tags, they increase welfare twice \n",
