    "This paper studies a heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian (HANK) model incorporating Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search and matching (SAM) from an analytical point of view. Due to the SAM structure, the model features an endogenous idiosyncratic earnings risk, which is empirically plausible to be countercyclical, and consequently, it induces a precautionary savings motive that results in downward pressure on real interest rates during recessions. In this setting, \n",

    "\n",
    "By mathematically analyzing a model in which heterogeneous households have labor contract matching with firms, this paper examines the effects of increasing unemployment risk during recessions on monetary policy, unemployment, inflation, the effects of technological progress, and economic stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the increased risk of unemployment during this recession encourages households to make precautionary savings, which in turn reduces consumption and job offers, suggesting the possibility of a high-unemployment economy. It also suggests the existence of an economy with zero interest rates and positive inflation at the same time. It also suggests that in order to avoid economic instability, the central bank may need to conduct more aggressive expansionary monetary policy (interest rate cuts) in response to high unemployment.\n",
