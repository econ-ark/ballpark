# Prior Literature Summary: "Population Aging and the Transmission of Monetary Policy to Consumption", by Arlene Wong

## The papers Wong cites

Based on the bibliography, Wong (2016) appears to have filled several important gaps by synthesizing and extending the existing literature in novel ways:

### Connecting Demographics to Monetary Policy Transmission

Prior work had largely treated these as separate topics. On one hand, papers like Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1984, 1989), Abel (2002), and Ríos-Rull (1996, 2001) studied how demographics affect macroeconomic aggregates like capital accumulation and asset prices. On the other hand, papers like Auclert (2019), Kaplan and Violante (2014), and Di Maggio, Kermani, and Ramcharan (2014) studied how household heterogeneity affects monetary policy transmission. Wong appears to have been among the first to explicitly link population aging to the effectiveness of monetary policy through consumption responses, asking whether an aging population systematically changes how monetary policy works.

### Integrating Multiple Transmission Channels

The literature had identified several channels through which monetary policy affects consumption—housing wealth effects (Mian and Sufi 2013; Berger et al. 2018), mortgage refinancing (Hurst and Stafford 2004; Bhutta and Keys 2016), and redistribution between borrowers and savers (Doepke and Schneider 2006; Auclert 2019). Wong's contribution seems to have been showing how these channels vary systematically with age, since younger households are more likely to be borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages while older households are more likely to hold interest-bearing assets.

### Policy-Relevant Implications for Aging Societies

While Imam (2015) and Juselius and Takáts (2015) had begun exploring whether demographics weaken monetary policy, Wong appears to have provided a more structural, microeconomic foundation by modeling how life-cycle consumption behavior interacts with monetary transmission. This offered a deeper understanding of why aging might matter, rather than simply documenting correlations.

## Key foundational papers

- **Kaplan and Violante (2014)**, "A Model of the Consumption Response to Fiscal Stimulus Payments" - This paper introduced the concept of "wealthy hand-to-mouth" households and demonstrated that heterogeneity in household balance sheets, particularly the distinction between liquid and illiquid assets, is crucial for understanding how policy affects consumption. This framework fundamentally shaped how economists think about monetary policy transmission through household heterogeneity, and is central to understanding why age—which correlates strongly with asset composition—matters for policy transmission.

- **Auclert (2019)**, "Monetary Policy and the Redistribution Channel" - This paper provided a systematic theoretical framework for understanding how monetary policy affects consumption through redistribution across households with different exposures to interest rate changes. It decomposed the channels through which monetary policy operates (income, wealth, and interest rate exposure) and showed how household heterogeneity determines aggregate policy effectiveness. This directly motivates analyzing how demographic composition affects monetary transmission.

- **Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013)**, "Household Balance Sheets, Consumption, and the Economic Slump" - This empirical paper demonstrated the powerful connection between household balance sheets, housing wealth, and consumption at the regional level during the Great Recession. It established key empirical approaches for linking geographic variation in household financial positions to consumption responses, providing both methodological tools and motivation for studying how household characteristics mediate policy effects.
