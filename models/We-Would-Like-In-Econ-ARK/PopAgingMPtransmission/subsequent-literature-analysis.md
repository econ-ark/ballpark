## Research Directions That Emerged

The literature citing Wong (2016) has developed along several interconnected trajectories:

### 1. The Refinancing Channel as a Core Transmission Mechanism

A major strand of research has focused intensively on mortgage refinancing as a key channel through which monetary policy affects household consumption. This includes both empirical work documenting the magnitude of these effects (Di Maggio et al. 2017; Abel and Fuster 2021; Amromin, Bhutta, and Keys 2020) and theoretical work modeling the state-dependent nature of refinancing behavior (Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Wong 2022; Berger et al. 2021).

### 2. Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) Models

The field has moved decisively toward incorporating household heterogeneity into macroeconomic models of monetary policy. Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2016) represents a watershed moment, establishing that models with heterogeneous agents produce fundamentally different predictions about monetary transmission than representative agent models. This framework has become the new benchmark for studying monetary policy.

### 3. Regional and State-Dependent Heterogeneity

Researchers have explored how the effects of monetary policy vary across space and time. Beraja et al. (2019) showed that the refinancing channel's strength depends on the regional distribution of housing equity, while Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Wong (2022) demonstrated that monetary policy effectiveness depends on the state of the economy and the history of interest rates.

### 4. Housing Market Structure and Mortgage Design

Work by Guren, Krishnamurthy, and McQuade (2018) and Greenwald (2016) has examined how the institutional features of mortgage markets—contract terms, prepayment options, down payment requirements—shape monetary transmission. This connects to policy debates about optimal mortgage market design.

### 5. Distributional Consequences of Monetary Policy

Coibion et al. (2017) and the broader literature on monetary policy and inequality have examined how monetary policy affects different households differently, with implications for both efficiency and equity.

## What's Cutting-Edge Now

The frontier of this literature appears to be:

- **Path dependence and history dependence**: Understanding how past interest rates and refinancing decisions affect current policy effectiveness (Berger et al. 2021)
- **Endogenous housing and mortgage choices**: Models where households' housing tenure and mortgage decisions respond to policy, creating feedback effects (Kinnerud 2025; Guren et al. 2018)
- **Quantitative HANK models**: Calibrated models that can match micro-level consumption and balance sheet data while generating realistic aggregate dynamics
- **Interaction of multiple channels**: How refinancing, wealth effects, income effects, and redistribution channels interact and potentially offset each other

## Most Important Papers for Understanding Where the Field Is Heading

### 1. Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Wong (2022), "State-Dependent Effects of Monetary Policy: The Refinancing Channel"

This paper (co-authored by Wong herself) represents a direct extension of the 2016 work. It demonstrates that monetary policy's effectiveness varies substantially depending on the distribution of existing mortgage rates in the economy. When many households have mortgages with rates above current market rates, monetary easing is powerful; when most have already refinanced, the channel is muted. This state dependence has profound implications for how central banks should think about policy in different environments and connects to debates about forward guidance and quantitative easing.

### 2. Beraja, Fuster, Hurst, and Vavra (2019), "Regional Heterogeneity and the Refinancing Channel of Monetary Policy"

This paper showed empirically that the refinancing channel's strength depends critically on local housing market conditions. Regions where homeowners had negative or low equity could not refinance even when rates fell, weakening monetary transmission precisely where stimulus was most needed. This geographic heterogeneity has important implications for understanding why monetary policy may have limited effectiveness following housing busts and connects to policy discussions about programs like HARP.

### 3. Berger, Milbradt, Tourre, and Vavra (2021), "Mortgage Prepayment and Path-Dependent Effects of Monetary Policy"

This paper develops a structural model showing how the history of interest rates affects the current distribution of mortgage rates, creating path dependence in monetary policy effectiveness. It provides a rigorous framework for understanding why the "refinancing channel" varies over time and offers tools for quantifying how past policy decisions constrain current policy options. This represents the cutting edge of integrating mortgage market microstructure into macroeconomic models.
