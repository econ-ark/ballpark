    "## Summary\n",
    "The paper uses the numerical technique to give an accurate approximation to the solution for consumption with stochastic labot income and constant relative risk aversion utility. The resulting consumption function differs with the certainty equivlaence solution. The results help explain three important empirical consumptions puzzzles: excess sensitivity of consumption to transitory income, high growth of consumption in the presence of a low risk-free interest rate, and underspending of the elderly.\n",

    "The problem is formulated as a one-state (wealth), one-control (consumption), one-disturbance (income) stochastic control problem. The state space is diecretized into an $S$ element grid using a technique suggested by Bertsekas (1976). Beginning in the last period, backwards induction in used to solve for the value function and corresponding optimal consumption. The computer algorithm searches, for each state and time, over all feasible levels of consumption and choose the one that maximizes the sum of current utility and the discounted expected value of next period's value function. The results are two $S \\times T$ matices which give optimal consumption and the value function at all possible levels of wealth and times left to live.\n",

    "    The slope of the #2 curve, which is equal to the marginal propensity to consume out of a transitory change in income, is considerably larger than that predicted by certainty equivalence. This means that we should expect MPCs out of transitory changes in income to be much larger for households with low current (certain) assets relative to expected future (uncertain) income than for the rest of the population. \n",

    "    Figure II shows that the optimal consumption function for this distribution is similar to that of the random walk/i.i.d. process (#2) used earlier. The results from extending the time horizon to 30 and 60 years (not shown) indicate that, holding financial assets constant, the percentage difference from CEQ is approximately the same regardless of age (i.e., horizon). Thus, the fact that the young have more uncertainty about lifetime resources is approximately offset by the fact that they also have more periods left to spread out any unexpected changes in current income. Increasing the time horizon does not diminish the effects of income uncertainty on the level of consumption.\n",

    "* Sensitivity of Consumption with regard to Changes in Expected Future Income (Permanent Income Shock)(not shown in figure 2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Holding current assets constant at 200, an one-unit increase in $YL_t$ increases expected income in every future period by one unit. The slope of the consumption line under CEQ is (T - 1)/T.25 and the sensitivity of consumption to expected future income is only about 60 percent as large as the CEQ benchmark. If initial wealth is instead equal to 400, the sensitivity of consumption to expected future income is much closer to the CEQ benchmark.\n",
    "    A mean preserving spread is performed on the income distribution which raises the coefficient of variation from 0.55 to 0.71 (#1B, see Figure IV). A more risky income stream leads to lower consumption levels. At a wealth of 300, precautionary saving is 25 percent of $C_CEQ$, as opposed to 17 percent for the less risky income stream. Greater uncertainty does not necessarily imply a higher MPC out of transitory income, however. The rankings for the MPCs depend on the level of initial wealth.\n",

    "\n",
    "    At a wealth of 200, precautionary saving is 20 percent of optimal consumption. That is, if there were no income uncertainty, consumption would be 20 percent higher than it is with the uncertainty. At low levels of assets, the certainty-equivalent benchmark dramatically overstates the optimal level of consumption. At a wealth of 500, precautionary saving is still about 7 percent of the optimal consumption level. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Next consider the expected growth of consumption between this period and next, which, since $r = \\delta$, is equal to zero under CEQ. The results (not shown) indicate that at a wealth of 100, consumption is expected to grow by 25 percent between the first and second period. At a wealth of 200, this number drops down considerably to 2.5 pecent.\n",
