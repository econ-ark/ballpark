    "### Goal of the paper\n",
    "This paper is designed to study the relationship between the intertemporal behavior of taxes and wealth distribution in a Heterogeneous-Agent framework. While optimal-taxation problem appears quite often in the literature of representative agent model, it is much less often discussed in a heterogeneous-agent context, one of the reasons of which is that Representative Agent ('RA') model has much stronger welfare implications since the maximization of the social welfare and the maximization of the representative agent's welfare are equivalent. However, in Heterogeneous Agent ('HA') model, with a given social welfare function, we can still do that by studying how the government can manipulate the intertemporal prices to favor some groups over others."

    "###  Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper tries to study the optimal fiscal policy with heterogeneous agents on both of the normative side and positive side. On the normative side, the Pareto frontier on which there is a trade-off between 'equity and efficiency' is being traced in this paper. In addition, it also tries to find some positive implications since an ideal political system will select policies close to the Pareto frontier. Particularly when there are large fiscal shocks occurring like a war, the welfare differences among possible fiscal policies will differ a lot, which in turn could make the main argument of the paper more evident."

    "Different tax rates in different periods can distort intertemporal prices, which is an important redistribution tool of the government.\n",

    "\n",
    "By taxing labor in odd periods and subsidizing it in even periods, the government generates an artificial scarcity of  goods in odd periods, which is beneficial to the rentiers but very costly to the tax payers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A government that draws its main support from the people who pay taxes should optimally run larger deficits and wait for the end of the war to levy the taxes necessary to repay the defense expenses and vice versa.\n",

    "### Novelties of The Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a simple model, this paper tries to find a link between the way of financing large public project and political inclination with efficiency considerations. By doing that, it manages to reveal some features of the optimal distortionary fiscal policy in a 2-agent model. Besides the theoretical work, it also tries to validate its result through some empirical evidence. By a simulation of the economies of France and Britain during their war time, this paper shows that the patterns of fiscal policy suggested by the model coincide with the real patterns in history, so  it also has some political implications."
