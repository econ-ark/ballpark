    "{cite:t}`benhabib2019` builds on a rich tradition of heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models that seek to explain the observed distribution of wealth in the United States. The foundational framework originates with {cite:t}`bewley1983`, who introduced incomplete-markets models in which agents self-insure against idiosyncratic income shocks. {cite:t}`huggett1993` and {cite:t}`aiyagari1994` extended this framework into general equilibrium, establishing the workhorse \"Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari\" class of models. While these models successfully generate wealth dispersion, they consistently underpredict the concentration of wealth at the very top of the distribution \u2014 the thick right tail observed empirically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several strands of subsequent research sought to close this gap. {cite:t}`quadrini2000` and {cite:t}`cagetti2006` introduced entrepreneurship and its associated return heterogeneity as a mechanism for generating extreme wealth. {cite:t}`castaneda2003` showed that calibrating to a highly skewed earnings process could improve the fit to the upper tail. {cite:t}`denardi2004` demonstrated that voluntary bequests \u2014 particularly luxury bequests that grow with wealth \u2014 are important for transmitting large estates across generations. In parallel, {cite:t}`benhabib2011` and {cite:t}`benhabib2015` developed analytical results showing that stochastic returns to capital, combined with finite lifetimes and bequests, can generate Pareto-tailed stationary wealth distributions."

    "- {cite:t}`aiyagari1994` \u2014 Established the canonical incomplete-markets model with idiosyncratic earnings risk and a borrowing constraint, showing how precautionary saving generates wealth accumulation but fails to match the top of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- {cite:t}`denardi2004` \u2014 Introduced voluntary (luxury) bequest motives into a life-cycle model, demonstrating that intergenerational transfers are essential for matching the concentration of wealth among the richest households.\n",
    "\n",
    "- {cite:t}`benhabib2011` \u2014 Proved analytically that models with stochastic capital income and intergenerational wealth transfers generate Pareto-tailed stationary distributions, providing the theoretical foundation for the quantitative exercise in {cite:t}`benhabib2019`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- {cite:t}`castaneda2003` \u2014 Showed that a carefully calibrated earnings process with very high realizations (\"superstar\" earnings) can help match the U.S. wealth distribution, highlighting the role of labor income heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- {cite:t}`krusell1998` \u2014 Introduced discount-factor heterogeneity as an alternative mechanism for generating wealth inequality in general-equilibrium models, demonstrating that even small differences in patience can produce large differences in wealth."

    "### The Gap This Paper Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior models typically focused on one or two mechanisms for wealth concentration \u2014 earnings risk alone ({cite:t}`aiyagari1994`; {cite:t}`castaneda2003`), bequest motives alone ({cite:t}`denardi2004`), or return heterogeneity in isolation ({cite:t}`quadrini2000`; {cite:t}`cagetti2006`). While each mechanism could partially account for the thick tail of the wealth distribution, no single channel was sufficient. Moreover, earlier work had not jointly estimated all three channels within a unified framework that also matched social mobility patterns \u2014 the transition probabilities governing how families move across wealth brackets over generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`benhabib2019` fills this gap by embedding all three mechanisms \u2014 skewed earnings, heterogeneous returns to wealth, and wealth-dependent saving rates (via bequest motives) \u2014 into a single quantitative life-cycle model. Using the method of simulated moments, they estimate the model to jointly match the cross-sectional wealth distribution and intergenerational mobility matrices from the Survey of Consumer Finances. This allows them to decompose the relative contribution of each factor, revealing that capital income risk and differential savings are the primary drivers of the upper tail, while stochastic earnings are essential for matching social mobility."
