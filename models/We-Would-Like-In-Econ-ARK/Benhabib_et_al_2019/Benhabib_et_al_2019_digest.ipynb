        "\n",
        "The paper develops a macroeconomic model to explore wealth accumulation, distribution, and social mobility in the U.S., focusing on three main forces:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Stochastic Earnings: A large literature in the context of Aiyagari-Bewley economies has shown that income variability plays a key role in wealth inequality, affecting saving decisions and consumption patterns, particularly for the bottom 60% of households {cite:p}`aiyagari1994,castaneda2003`. However, it does not account for the wealth concentration among the wealthiest.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Heterogeneous Rate of Return: Studies have identified significant variations in the risk-adjusted returns on investments across households, contributing to the wealth distribution's long tail {cite:p}`fagereng2020,quadrini2000,cagetti2006`. This variation is consistent over time and linked with entrepreneurial activity. The theoretical foundations for this channel were laid by {cite:t}`benhabib2011`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Differential saving rates across wealth levels: The model includes increasing bequest motives with wealth, suggesting a stronger saving motive among the wealthiest, who aim to leave significant assets for their heirs {cite:p}`denardi2004`. This perpetuates the transfer of large estates through generations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis finds that stochastic earnings, differential savings, and capital income risk critically shape the wealth distribution's tail and social mobility. Capital income risk and differential savings widen the wealth distribution's tail and influence mobility, particularly enhancing it at the top end but reducing upward mobility from the bottom 20%. Despite being less impactful in the tail, stochastic earnings are vital for overall wealth mobility. Additionally, their findings suggest a wealth-dependent return rate enhances model fit across the wealth distribution. The stochastic process for returns which best fits the data shares statistical properties with those uncovered by {cite:t}`fagereng2020` from Norwegian tax records.\n"

In particular, paper conducted an analysis using the SCF 1962–1963 wealth distribution as a starting point, estimating model parameters to match with the 2007 SCF distribution and previously used transition matrices. The findings highlight a significant rise in wealth inequality during this period, with the top 1% share increasing from 24.2% to 33.6%. The updated estimates reveal that this surge in inequality can be traced through enhanced capital income risk and differential savings, resulting in a skewed wealth distribution that closely matches empirical data, especially at the higher end. However, this model overestimates social mobility across wealth brackets. \n",

        "\n",
        "The authors of the paper developed a standard macroeconomic model to explore the distribution of wealth in the United States, with a specific focus on the distribution's tail. The model is notable for its ability to closely fit the observed data across the entire wealth spectrum and accurately capturing the social mobility trends. Through their analysis, the authors successfully identified three key factors contributing to wealth accumulation: skewed and persistent earnings distribution, differential saving and bequest rates across wealth levels, and capital income risk associated with entrepreneurship. Each factor plays a distinct and empirically validated role in shaping both the wealth distribution and mobility. The paper also delves into the transitional dynamics of wealth distribution, with preliminary findings suggesting rapid changes over time, indicating promising areas for future research.\n",

        "   - having luxury-type bequest motives. In their absence, even agents located at lower end of the wealth distribution saves for leaving bequests. But that is not supported in data. Luxury-type bequest motives can solve that problem.\n",
