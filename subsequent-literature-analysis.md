# Subsequent Literature Analysis: The Optimum Quantity of Debt (Aiyagari & McGrattan, 1998)

## Papers that cite my ballpark paper

I found 18 papers in LitMaps.

## What the subsequent literature tells us

The follow-on work pushes the “debt as liquidity” insight into richer, more policy-relevant heterogeneous-agent settings. A key direction is **joint fiscal–monetary design**: rather than studying debt/taxes in isolation, recent papers analyze how debt policy interacts with monetary policy and liquidity when households are constrained and markets are incomplete.

Another direction is **methods and implementation**: improved numerical techniques make it easier to solve optimal policy problems (and especially transitions) in high-dimensional HA models, which in turn enables studying targeted interventions and distributional effects. There is also movement toward **constraints that matter for real policy** (political feasibility, sustainability notions, and spillovers in more open settings).

Open questions that show up repeatedly are: how to characterize **optimal debt paths** (not just long-run levels), how robust prescriptions are to **financial-sector frictions and crises**, and how well these mechanisms line up with **empirical evidence**—especially once distributional objectives and state-contingent policy rules are taken seriously.

## Most important subsequent papers

1. Le Grand & Ragot (2023), “Optimal Policies with Heterogeneous Agents: Truncation and Transitions”: New computational approach that makes optimal-policy HA models (especially transitions) more tractable, enabling more realistic policy experiments.
2. Bilbiie & Ragot (2020), “Optimal monetary policy and liquidity with heterogeneous households”: Puts liquidity and HA constraints at the center of optimal monetary policy, clarifying the fiscal–monetary interaction the original debt paper abstracts from.
3. Grand et al. (2021), “Optimal fiscal and monetary policy with heterogeneous agents”: Moves from “optimal debt” to integrated optimal policy design with multiple instruments in HA environments.
4. Chakrabarti et al. (2021), “Targeted interventions: Consumption dynamics and distributional effects”: Highlights the shift toward targeted policy and explicit distributional outcomes, not just aggregate welfare.
5. Carroll, Dolmas & Young (2021), “The politics of flat taxes”: Brings political feasibility/implementation constraints into the conversation, bridging normative prescriptions and what policies can actually pass.
