               provided by the neoclassical model may not be an adequate guide
               to policy, even if certain of its predictions are correct.
               Instead, I [the author] direct attention to an alternative
               explanation of the effects of changes in the level of public
               debt, which leads to very different conclusions about the welfare
               consequences of such policies. According to this view, 'Ricardian
               equivalence' fails because of imperfect financial intermediation.
               Some economic units are liquidity constrained, which is to say
               that they are unable to borrow against their future income at a
               rate of interest as low as that at which the government borrows.
               Increased government borrowing can benefit such parties, insofar
               as they effectively receive a highly liquid asset, government
               debts, in exchange for giving the government an increased claim
               on their future income, their own claim to which represented a
               highly illiquid asset. A higher public debt, insofar as it
               implies a higher proportion of liquid assets in private sector
               wealth, increases the flexibility of the private sector in
               responding to variation in both income and spending
               opportunities, and so can increase economic efficiency.''",

               infinite time horizon economy in which individual families have
               finite life-spans but are connected with other generations
               through bequests. We construct a model of family bequest
               behaviour based on utility maximization and combine it with a
               simple, aggregative description of production. We then show that
               the overall model always has at least one steady-state
               equilibrium. Although we do not argue that bequest-motivated
               saving must necessarily play a major role in total capital
               accumulation, we do derive the following result: bequests will
               become an overwhelmingly important source of capital in
               situations in which the steady-state interest rate approaches a
               level P 1 derived in our analysis. Thus, at minimum, bequest
               behaviour has a safety value role, preventing a steady-state
               interest rate too much above the golden rule level and, hence,
               putting a lower bound on potential steady-state capital-to-labour
               ratios. We also present a second, somewhat different, application
               of our steady-state model: we show that the government can always
               change the steady-state interest rate with a properly designed
               shift between tax and debt financing of its spending. This result
               conflicts with the argument that government debt is not a
               component of private aggregate net worth since the discounted
               value of future debt service should exactly counterbalance the
               value now of any new government bonds issued. The organization of
               this paper is as follows. The first section sets up our bequest
               model for families. The second establishes the existence of at
               least one steady state and derives a lower bound for the
               aggregate capital-to-labour ratio. The third discusses government
               debt. All proofs for the propositions of this paper are in a
