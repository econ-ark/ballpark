# Prior Literature Summary: The Optimum Quantity of Debt (Aiyagari & McGrattan, 1998)

## The papers my ballpark paper cites

Aiyagari & McGrattan (1998) builds on prior work establishing that liquidity constraints fundamentally change how government debt affects the economy. Bewley (1983) introduced the framework of infinitely lived agents facing uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and borrowing constraints, showing how precautionary saving motives emerge. Aiyagari (1994) extended this to a quantitative general equilibrium growth model, demonstrating how uninsured risk affects aggregate saving and wealth distribution. Woodford (1990) showed that public debt can serve as liquid assets when financial intermediation is imperfect, providing liquidity benefits and breaking Ricardian equivalence. Optimal taxation theory (Chamley 1986) provided the framework for analyzing the costs of debt-financed government spending.

Despite these advances, a quantitative gap remained: prior work established mechanisms but did not quantify the optimal level of government debt. Woodford (1990) showed liquidity benefits but did not quantify the optimal level. Aiyagari (1994) provided a quantitative framework but focused on aggregate saving, not optimal debt policy. Barro (1979) and Chamley (1986) analyzed optimal fiscal policy in representative-agent models without liquidity constraints. Aiyagari & McGrattan (1998) filled this gap by combining the Bewley-Aiyagari framework, Woodford's liquidity insight, optimal taxation theory, and quantitative methods to provide a numerical answer: what is the optimal debt-to-GDP ratio? Their main finding—that welfare gains from moving to the optimal debt level are small—suggests concerns about high US debt levels may be overstated, a quantitative conclusion that prior theoretical work could not provide.

## Key foundational papers

- **Bewley (1983) - "A difficulty with the optimum quantity of money"**: Introduced the Bewley model framework with infinitely lived agents facing uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, borrowing constraints, and precautionary saving motives. This is the core theoretical foundation that all subsequent heterogeneous-agent models with liquidity constraints build upon.

- **Aiyagari (1994) - "Uninsured idiosyncratic risk and aggregate saving"**: Extended Bewley's framework to a full general equilibrium growth model with production, showing how uninsured risk affects aggregate saving and wealth distribution. This paper provided the direct methodological foundation and quantitative framework that Aiyagari & McGrattan (1998) uses.

- **Woodford (1990) - "Public debt as private liquidity"**: Established the key insight that government debt can serve as liquid assets when financial intermediation is imperfect, providing liquidity benefits and breaking Ricardian equivalence. This paper is central to Aiyagari & McGrattan's analysis of the benefits of government debt.

- **Chamley (1986) - "Optimal taxation of capital income in general equilibrium"**: Provided the optimal taxation framework used to analyze the costs of debt-financed government spending, establishing how distortionary taxes affect welfare in general equilibrium models.

- **Barro (1979) - "On the determination of the public debt"**: Established Ricardian equivalence, which Woodford (1990) and Aiyagari & McGrattan (1998) show fails with liquidity constraints. This paper represents the benchmark theory that Aiyagari & McGrattan's work modifies.
