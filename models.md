# Models We Would Like to Have in Econ-ARK

There are many that we would like to have implemented using HARK; this directory contains a very incomplete list.

1. **Index notebook** [We-Would-Like-In-Econ-ARK.ipynb](models/We-Would-Like-In-Econ-ARK.ipynb)
   * Brief summaries of features of a set of interesting models

2. **Directory** [We-Would-Like-In-Econ-ARK](models/We-Would-Like-In-Econ-ARK/)
   * Organized by citekey in [our public Zotero bibliographical database](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2314611/ballpark)
   * Slide presentations of the models, organized by the creator of the slides

3. **Directory** [Already-Partway-In-Econ-ARK](tools/Already-Partway-In-Econ-ARK/)
   * Lives under `tools/` (tools that accomplish computational operations)
   * Description of what is in Econ-ARK (and where) and what we would like to add
   * Organized by citekey in [our public Zotero bibliographical database](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2314611/ballpark)
